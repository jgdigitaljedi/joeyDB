# Joey DB

This repo is a backend I am throwing up to store my video game collection and, eventually, more things as I continue to work on personal projects. It is the first time I am building a GraphQL backend, first time using Apollo, and the first time I am using TypeScript with Node so it is also meant to be a learning experience.

## Setup

clone the project, then:

```
npm i
```

## Tasks

To serve and watch:
```
npm start
```

To build:
```
npm run build
```

To run production build (after build task is run):
```
npm start:prod
```
